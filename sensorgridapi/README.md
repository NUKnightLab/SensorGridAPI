# API Setup
To get the Django REST API set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/verdinjoshua26/SensorGridAPI.git
cd SensorGridAPI
```
If you have just installed the project, run:
```
mkvirtualenv sgapienv
```
Or if you have already run it before run this to get into the virtualenv:
```
workon sgapienv
```
After you are in the correct virtualenv, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now that you have your environment set up and up to date,
```
cd sensorgridapi
```
To create a basic database:
```
./manage.py makemigrations <APPNAME>
./manage.py migrate
```
To start a local server and view the admin backend:
```
./manage.py runserver
```
To add an administrator to the site:
```
./manage.py createsuperuser
```
To work on Django in the command line:
```
./manage.py shell
```

# API endpoints
Note that for any endpoint you can include a `node_id=<INT>` to return only the data from that node. On the other hand, the command `node_id_include` will return a subset of the data model with `node_id` values, but will not allow you to filter that subset according to a specific `node_id`.

Below are the most vital endpoints for our SensorGrid Dashboard. To see all endpoints, go to `./sensorgridapi/sensordata/views.py`.

`/sensordata/?node_id=<INT>` - Returns an array of sensor data objects with the corresponding ID.

`/sensordata/created_at_lt=<EPOCH>` - Returns an array of sensor data objects created before the epoch timestamp inputted.

`/sensordata/created_at_gt=<EPOCH>` - Returns an array of sensor data objects created after the epoch timestamp inputted.

`/sensordata/?battery&node_id_include` - Returns an array of objects containing a node's ID and battery.

`/sensordata/?battery&node_id=<INT>` - Returns an array of objects containing the battery values of the specified node ID.

`/sensordata/?data&data_type&node_id=<INT>` - Returns an array of objects corresponding to the specified node ID with the value of each sensor's data point and SensorDataSerializer_timestamp corresponding data type.

`/sensordata/?data&data_type&node_id_include` - Returns an array of objects containing each node's ID, data value, and data type.
